## Introduction

What is this paper about?
What is discussed?
Why is it of any consequence?

This paper will look at the reproducibility vs replicability question often posed in the field of science.
In recent year their has been an "crisis" in many academic fields due study's might present false findings\@ioannidis2005b.
In fields where this is the case, false princibles can are part of the fields foundation .
This paper will discuss whether or not reproducibility is enough for publications too be viewed as valid, or replicability needs to be the standard.

## Literature review

Firstly I will define the two terms, and look at what separates them.
Steven Goodman defines Reproducibility as the ability to achieve the same results when redoing an previous study when the same data and approach is used @goodman2016b.
Today, this is considered the minimum requirement for the findings of an study being valid @ioannidis2005b.
In order for a study's findings to be reproducible a key set of factors need to be in place.
The data used must be presented to the reader in a way that is suitable to collect and reuse in an recreation.
Then there must be a good description of what model and algorithms, with a good protocol description.
And it is important that all software and witch version was used is clearly specified.

Replicability on the other hand is when the same results can be found from a different population.

In 2019 the United States of America saw the potential threat of false findings, and made an committee with the goal of giving researches and better understanding and baseline for the importance of trustworthy Science.
The committee witch consisted of high profile industry leaders across many different scientific areas collaborated on this.
As a result in 2019 there was released an very in dept paper on the subject that raised some good observations.

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@gentleman2005 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@barbalorenaa.2018; @bartlett2008].

## Discussion of the reseach question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?

A central question is weather or not replicability should be the norm for scientific study, or if this is too much to ask.
I would argue that to what extend we can expect researchers to achive the goal of replicability varies between fields of science.
Some fields are controlled and universal laws applie, for instance in physics and chemistry related research.
Since these are based on "laws of nature", and should not be affected buy culture and individual differences, I think that there should be expectancy for replicability today.
Comparibly in some fields individual differences can be excepted to affect the outcome when using different sets of data.
This can for example be behavioral ecomincs studys.
To give an example: If you have a dataset of 1000 peoples attitudes toward risk, that might give the conclusiojn that most people are risk averse.
If the same studie is run again with different 1000 data sets, the conclusion may be that most people are risk seeking.
