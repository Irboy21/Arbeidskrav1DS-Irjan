## Introduction

What is this paper about?
What is discussed?
Why is it of any consequence?

This paper will look at the reproducibility vs replicability question often posed in the field of science.
In recent year their has been an "crisis" in many academic fields due to concerns many study's might present false findings @ioannidis2005b.
This paper will discuss whether or not reproducibility is enough for publications too be viewed as valid, or replicability needs to be the standard.
This is an important topic due to the possibility of false principles being a part of the fields foundation .
This can lead to much time and effort being wasted of further research and development

## Literature review

Firstly I will define the two terms, and look at what separates them.
Steven Goodman defines Reproducibility as the ability to achieve the same results when redoing an previous study when the same data and approach is used @goodman2016b Today, this is considered the minimum requirement for the findings of an study being valid @ioannidis2005b .
In order for a study's findings to be reproducible a key set of factors need to be in place.
The data used must be presented to the reader in a way that is suitable to collect and reuse in an recreation.
Then there must be a good description of what model and algorithms, with a good protocol description.
And it is important that all software and used version used is clearly specified @gentleman2005b .
Only if all these factors are in place, an outside party from the original study will have the ability to recreate the experiment.
When a study is recreated on a good reproducible foundation, it will be much easier to confirm or disprove the proposed findings of a paper @plesser2018 .
Robert Gentleman argues that if these the are not properly documented, the thought of reproduce an original experiment almost imposible.
If you cannot confirm the findings outside of the research group that released the original findings, one should be careful to take them to hearth.

Replicability on the other hand is when the same results can be found from a different population.

An interesting question is why there are created research papers that are neither reproducible nor replicable.
@markowetz2015a argues from the view of an individual scientist, there can be found good egosentrical reasons to not strive for this.
Making once research reproducable can be viewd as an time consuming process.
By skipping this step the researcher spends less time on each paper.
He can therefor realese more papers, with can mean bigger monitory and carrer advancing benefits.
But given the increasing concern about reproducible science, this approach today might be shooting yourself in the foot, as your research may be found seriousness and harm further opportunities as an scientist.
In his article, @markowetz2015a gives 5 reasons why it pays off to work reproducible.
The first reasons is to avoid disaster.
If much resources has been used in a field based on a specific finding, and later that finding turns out to not hold water, there will be many negative consequences.
He also argues that the writing process actually will be easier when ones work is reproducible.
When you make transparent data and codes, it will make the process of writing and adjusting the paper to fit the findings of the data easier.
His third argument is that it is important to have peers in you back when realizing a paper.
Other scientist will much easier then the general public see through bad documentation.
This can lead to bad reviews and reputation among others in you field.
Another reasons he gives is that it will be easier to make further research when you continue writing papers in the future.
If your original paper is well documented, it will be much easier to ensure a continuity when developing your earlier findings.

In 2019 the United States of America saw the potential threat of false findings, and made an committee with the goal of giving researches and better understanding and baseline for the importance of trustworthy Science.
The committee witch consisted of high profile industry leaders across many different scientific areas collaborated on this.
As a result in 2019 there was released an very in dept paper on the subject that raised some good observations.

@committeeonreproducibilityandreplicabilityinscience2019

@dewald1986b Wrote an article in the 80s where he pointed out that spending time replicating others people work, dos not lead to the same recognition as making completely new studies and findings.
A researcher working on validating someone elses work over creating something for his own, might be considered lazy or unimaginative.
@wolfgang2025 wrote a more recent article, published in 2025.
He indicates that through the years reproducible papers dont have the same kind of "stigma" as it did earlier.
This helps confirm that the threat unproven science holds have a more serious status then earlier.
This should be seen as a very good evolution.
@nosek2015 says that when we make a move towards a more transparent environment in our research, we will have much more credible claims in the future.
This will reduce the amount of time and money used trying to reach dead end resaults.

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@gentleman2005 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@barbalorenaa.2018; @bartlett2008].

## Discussion of the reseach question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?

A central question is weather or not replicability should be the norm for scientific study, or if this is too much to ask.
I would argue that to what extend we can expect researchers to achive the goal of replicability varies between fields of science.
Some fields are controlled and universal laws applie, for instance in physics and chemistry related research.
Since these are based on "laws of nature", and should not be affected buy culture and individual differences, I mean that in those fields there should be and higher expectancy for replicability.
Comparibly in other fields individual differences can be excepted to affect the outcome when using different sets of data.
This can for example be behavioral ecomincs studys.
To give an example: If you have a dataset of 1000 peoples attitudes toward risk, that might give the conclusion that most people are risk averse.
If the same studie is run again with a new set of data, the conclusion may be that most people are risk seeking.
Therefor as a baseline I would conclude that when we see that there are examples not meeting the reproducibility standard, it is too early to expect replicability over the board.
But with the wave of new digital tools we are getting to a point where making reproducible reaserch should be achivable for everybody who is willing to put in the time/effort.
One of the most prominent innovations here is "quarto documents".
Quarto documents make research more transparent.
Quarto lets you combine texting and coding in one document.
The figures used in the reasoning of a finding can therefor be directly linked to the code that produced it.
This elements the need for external peers looking to reproduce the study to make thees from scratch, they can simply re-run the experiment based on the parmiiters that already exist in the document.
Another problem that gets eliminated is deviation based on sowtfare.
Traditionally a problem that may occur is that the reproduction of a finding is reliant on using the same software and even version that the original was run on.

Despite the use of digital assets there is still some issues that can hinder reproducibility.
