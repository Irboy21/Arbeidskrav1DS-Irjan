## General comments

- Nice paper
- Added `citeproc: true`to YAML. Forces `typst` to use bibtex.
- Moved `number-sections: true` and `papersize: a4` out of format to make it default for all relevant formats.
- added `out-file: "Assignment_Irjan_tex.pdf"` to pdf format. Else `typst` and `pdf` will overwrite each others pdf file.
- Changed bibliography entry to the new `quarto` way. Easier if you need to specify multiple bib files.
- Made a little change to the end of abstarct.
- Changed "crisis" to “crisis”. Makes a difference in pdf output.
- Use `[@ioannidis2005b]` for end of sentence reference and `@ioannidis2005b` for in-text reference.
- I have fixed some typos and suggested some changes to the text.
- Nice commit history

## Tips and Tricks

- Added `docx: default` as format. Nice to have the opportunity.
